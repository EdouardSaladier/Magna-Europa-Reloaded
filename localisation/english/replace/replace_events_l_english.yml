 lar_france_french_union.2.t:1 "Algeria votes to join the Union"
 lar_france_french_union.2.desc:1 "Surprising many observers, the people in Algeria have approved the referendum on the French Union by a narrow margin. With the inhabitants of those areas now considered full citizens, they are permitted to return a number of deputies to the National Assembly.\n\nWhile nationalist elements in all three countries still remain, they have been dealt a crippling blow to their morale and will require at least a generation to recover."
 lar_france_french_union.2.a:1 "They understand the meaning of Fraternité!"
 lar_france_french_union.3.t:1 "Algeria votes to leave"
 lar_france_french_union.3.desc:1 "Despite all efforts by the local governments, the voters in Algeria have overwhelmingly rejected the proposed French Union. Immediately following the announcement of the results, large demonstrations took place in several major cities across the area as nationalist groups capitalized on their victory to demand the immediate and full independence of their countries.\n\nThe Commander of French Forces in Algeria has sent an urgent request for reinforcements as it appears likely that some more radical elements might attempt to take matters into their own hands."
 lar_france_french_union.3.a:1 "Such ingratitude!"
 lar_france_french_union.4.t:1 "West Africa votes to join the Union"
 lar_france_french_union.4.desc:1 "Following weeks of campaigning, people all across the French territories in western Africa were called to the polls to decide whether their territories should be part of the new French Union. The preliminary results show a healthy majority for the Union side. The nationalist cause appears to have been smothered in its infancy, with many independence activists now preparing to continue the struggle for more political self-determination from within the National Assembly."
 lar_france_french_union.5.t:1 "West Africa votes to leave"
 lar_france_french_union.5.desc:1 "After an intense and sometimes tumultuous campaign, it appears that the nationalist side has won the referendum on membership in the French Union in most areas of French West Africa. While the local Europeans are still trying to digest the result, leaders of local independence movements have clamored for action and proclaimed the result as a clear mandate for full independence."
 lar_france_french_union.6.t:1 "Tunisia and Morocco votes to join the Union"
 lar_france_french_union.6.desc:1 "With results coming in slowly from across the protectorates, it appears that a slim majority of voters has approved the referendum to join the new French Union. Nationalist groups have conceeded defeat, but demanded that the new state invest more into developing the region to reward the show of loyalty."
 lar_france_french_union.7.t:1 "Tunisia and Morocco votes to leave"
 lar_france_french_union.7.desc:1 "Pro-Union parties across French Tunisia and Morocco have suffered a series of political setbacks as one territory after another voted against joining the new French Union. With pro-independence parties celebrating victory after victory, many activists claim that French overlordship over the region has been resoundingly defeated."
 lar_france_french_union.8.t:1 "Syria votes to join the Union"
 lar_france_french_union.8.desc:1 "The French mandate of Syria has voted to become part of the new French Union. While many observers considered this result unlikely at best, it appears that the local population believes that membership in the French Union will guarantee access to European markets and more investment in the local economy."
 lar_france_french_union.9.t:1 "Syria votes against the Union"
 lar_france_french_union.9.desc:1 "The announcement of the results of the recent referendum on the French Union was met with loud cheers in Damascus, as it became clear that the region had overwhelmingly voted against joining the new Union. With the main nationalist parties already declaring the referendum a vote on independence in disguise, the local military commander has sent a series of unsettling reports to the capital demanding reinforcements."
 lar_france_french_union.10.t:1 "Lebanon votes to join the Union"
 lar_france_french_union.10.desc:1 "Reports coming in from Lebanon indicate that the people of Lebanon have, with the smallest of margins, voted to become part of the new French Union. This appears to have caught even local administrators by surprise, as they immediately ordered a recount of the votes. Nationalist groups in the region have been dealt a severe blow as their morale collapsed, with many members openly wondering if they really represent the will of the people as they believe they do."
 lar_france_french_union.11.t:1 "Lebanon votes against the Union"
 lar_france_french_union.11.desc:1 "The referendum results coming in from Lebanon paint a grimmer picture than expected. While few in the capital believed that the nationalist hotbeds would vote to join the union, it appears that nationalist sentiments are far wider spread than previously believed. In the event, no part of the territory returned a majority to join the union. Nationalist activists are already clamoring for immediate seccession from France, even at the cost of war, believing that this is the moment to gain their national independence."

 news.103.d:1 "[119.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], birthplace of the Russian Revolution, has fallen to advancing German forces. \n\nSporadic fighting can still be heard from some suburbs, but a strange calm appears to have settled over the rest of the ruined city.\n\nEarlier today, columns of German soldiers marched past St. Isaac's Cathedral, whose great dome has been painted gray by [SOV.GetSovietArmyAdjectiveBasedOnIdeology] Army engineers to avoid the attention of marauding Luftwaffe bombers. \nDespite their efforts, it is riddled with bullet holes and shrapnel impacts."
 finland.1.t:1 "The [FROM.GetAdjective]s Demand Border Revisions"
 finland.1.d:1 "Citing the need to create a security buffer for [195.GetName], officials from [FROM.GetNameDef] have asked for a revision of our borders. They want us to cede a small portion of Karelia to them, and judging by the build-up of [FROM.GetAdjective] forces along our border, they will not take no for an answer. They also demand islands in the Gulf of Finland and a lease on the Hanko Peninsula, and promise to cede Repola and Porajarvi in return. How should we respond?"
 soviet.12.d:1 "The overwhelming forces we massed along their borders have convinced the [FROM.GetAdjective] government to accept our modest request for a revision of their borders. We have gained control of the portion of Karelia, and the position of [195.GetName] is now much more secure. We can either continue with our momentum and demand the rest of western Karelia, or we will honor the agreement and cede Repola and Porajarvi."
