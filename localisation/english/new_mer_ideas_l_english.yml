 IRE_free_state_idea_desc:0 "The Constitution of the Irish Free State (§CBunreacht Shaorstát Eireann§!) established a parliamentary system of government under a form of constitutional monarchy, and contained guarantees of certain fundamental rights. It was intended that the constitution would be a rigid document that, after an initial period, could be amended only by referendum. However, amendments were made to the Constitution's amendment procedure, so that all amendments could be and were in fact made by a simple Act of the Oireachtas (parliament). By pulling our strings the right way, independence would be just at our fingertips."
